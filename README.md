# Hello Elm!

---

"a delightful language for reliable webapps"

---

* a language
* compiles to JS
* has its own package ecosystem
* focused on building browser apps

---

```javascript
// JavaScript
function incrementAll(numbers) {
    return numbers.map(num => num + 1);
}
```

---

```elm
-- Elm
incrementAll numbers =
    List.map (\num -> num + 1) numbers
```

---

```elm
-- Elm
incrementAll : List number -> List number
incrementAll numbers =
    List.map (\num -> num + 1) numbers
```

* functional
* statically typed
* in the ML family (Haskell, OCaml, Purescript)
